# PharmaTrack System

## Project Description

PharmaTrack System is a revolutionary blockchain-based pharmaceutical supply chain tracking solution built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. The system prevents counterfeit drugs from entering the market and ensures patient safety by providing transparent, immutable tracking of pharmaceutical products from manufacturer to end consumer.

The platform enables authorized manufacturers to register pharmaceutical products with complete batch information, manufacturing dates, and expiry details. Healthcare providers, pharmacies, and consumers can verify drug authenticity in real-time, creating an unbreakable chain of trust in the pharmaceutical supply chain.

Key features include:
- **Immutable Drug Registration**: Secure recording of pharmaceutical products with comprehensive metadata
- **Real-time Verification**: Instant authentication of drug legitimacy and supply chain history
- **Manufacturer Authorization**: Controlled access ensuring only legitimate pharmaceutical companies can register products
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Transparent tracking of all verification events and supply chain movements
- **Counterfeit Prevention**: Blockchain-based verification makes drug counterfeiting virtually impossible

## Project Vision

To create a world where every pharmaceutical product can be instantly verified for authenticity, eliminating the $200+ billion annual global counterfeit drug market and saving millions of lives through enhanced drug safety and supply chain transparency.

Our vision encompasses:

### Short-term Goals (1-2 years)
